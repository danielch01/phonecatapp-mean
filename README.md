# PhoneCatApp
---
This is a repeat of the phonecat app from the AngularJS tutorial located at: https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_00
However, instead of just using AngularJS and JSON files, this tutorial utilizes the full power of the MEAN stack. The first few commits will involve connecting to `http://localhost:3000` server  but later commits will involve setting up a MongoDB server in the cloud.
